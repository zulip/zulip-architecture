# Zulip architecture proposals

This repository provides a place for the Zulip core team to propose, collaborate
on, and build consensus for design proposals. This will be an optional process,
encouraged for changes substantial enough that working out a good design at the
start is likely to save significant implementation work or future backwards
compatibility headaches.

The [ZAP process](./zaps/0001-zap-process.md) is intended to be
lightweight, with just enough formality to facilitate consensus. It is
inspired by the [Rust RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs),
which itself takes inspiration from the [Python PEP
process](https://peps.python.org/).
